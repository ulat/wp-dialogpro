# Prompts for code generation

English might be the best programming language to learn in the 21st century! The key to getting great code from your AI assistant is all in how you communicate your requests. I’ve learned (sometimes the hard way) that vague prompts lead to vague code. Here’s my go-to template for requesting code:

```
I need to implement [specific functionality] in [programming language].
Key requirements:
1. [Requirement 1]
2. [Requirement 2]
3. [Requirement 3]
Please consider:
- Error handling
- Edge cases
- Performance optimization
- Best practices for [language/framework]
Please do not unnecessarily remove any comments or code.
Generate the code with clear comments explaining the logic.
```

# Design and Architecture with AI

Use Think Step-by-Step” Prompts:

```
Let's think step-by-step about the architecture for [specific component or system].

Please consider:
1. The main functionalities this component needs to support
2. Potential data structures or models
3. Key classes or modules and their responsibilities
4. How this component will interact with other parts of the system
5. Potential design patterns that could be applicable
6. Considerations for scalability and maintainability

For each step, provide a brief explanation of your reasoning.
```

## Iterating on AI Suggestions

Now, here’s where the real magic happens. Once you get that initial response, don’t just take it and run. This is your chance to engage in a back-and-forth with your AI assistant, refining and improving the design.

```
Thank you for that initial design. I have a few follow-up questions:
1. What are the potential drawbacks or limitations of this approach?
2. Can you suggest an alternative design that prioritizes [specific concern, e.g., performance, flexibility]?
3. How would this design need to change if we needed to [potential future requirement]?
```

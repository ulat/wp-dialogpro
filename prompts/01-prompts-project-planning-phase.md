# Prompt Ideas to Get You Started

To help you hit the ground running, here are a few prompt ideas you can use right away:

## For setting up a new project:
I'm starting a new [type of project] using [programming language/framework]. Can you suggest a basic file structure and essential dependencies I should consider?

## For understanding AI’s capabilities:
What are the key strengths and limitations I should be aware of when using you for software development tasks?

## For creating a coding plan:
I want to build [brief project description]. Can you help me break this down into manageable tasks and suggest an order of implementation?

# Project Initialization and Planning

1. Project Overview: Start with a brief description of your project. What are you building? What problem is it solving?
2. Tech Stack: List out the languages, frameworks, and tools you’re planning to use.
3. Key Requirements: Outline the main features or functionalities you want to implement.
4. Constraints: Any limitations or specific requirements? Maybe you need to support older browsers or have strict performance criteria.
5. Coding Style: If you have specific coding conventions or architectural preferences, mention them.

`I'm starting a new project and I'd like to create a knowledge base for you to reference throughout our development process. The project is [brief description]. We'll be using [tech stack]. The key features we need to implement are [list features]. Some important constraints to keep in mind are [list constraints]. In terms of coding style, we prefer [mention preferences]. Can you summarize this information and suggest any additional details we should include in our knowledge base?``

# Breaking Down Projects into Manageable Components

Once you’ve got your project overview, it’s time to break it down into bite-sized pieces. I used to struggle with this, either making my components too large and unwieldy or getting lost in the minutiae. AI has been a game-changer for finding that sweet spot.

```
Based on the project overview we just created, can you help me break down this project into manageable components or modules? For each component, please suggest:
1. A name for the component
2. Its main functionality
3. Potential challenges in implementing it
4. How it might interact with other components
Please also recommend a logical order for developing these components.
```

# Using AI for Project Roadmapping

Once you have your components defined, it’s time to create a roadmap. This is where I really appreciate having an AI assistant. It’s like having a seasoned project manager at your fingertips, helping you foresee potential pitfalls and optimize your development sequence.

```
Using the component breakdown we've created, can you help me develop a project roadmap? 
Please include:
1. A suggested order for developing the components
2. Estimated time frames for each component (assuming I'm working on this part-time)
3. Potential milestones or checkpoints
4. Any dependencies between components that might affect the development order
5. Suggestions for any proof-of-concept or prototype stages that might be beneficial
```

# Prompt Ideas for Project Planning

To help you make the most of AI in your project planning phase, here are a few more prompt ideas:

## For risk assessment:

```Based on our project plan, can you identify potential risks or challenges we might face during development? For each risk, suggest possible mitigation strategies.```

## For technology selection:

```We're considering using [Technology A] or [Technology B] for [specific functionality]. Can you compare these options in the context of our project, considering factors like performance, ease of implementation, and future scalability?```

## For estimating project scope:

```Given our project requirements and component breakdown, can you help me estimate the overall scope of this project? Please provide a rough estimate of the total development time and suggest any areas where we might need to adjust our expectations or seek additional resources.```

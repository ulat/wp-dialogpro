# The AI Coding Workflow: A Step-by-Step Guide

1. Start with a clear specification: Define what you want to build as clearly as possible.
2. Generate initial code: Use a detailed prompt to get the AI to generate a first draft.
3. Review and understand: Go through the code carefully, making sure you understand every part.
4. Iterate and refine: Ask the AI for explanations, optimizations, and alternatives.
5. Test and debug: Use AI to help generate unit tests and debug any issues.
6. Optimize and refactor: Once the code is working, use AI to suggest optimizations and refactoring.
7. Document: Use AI to help generate clear documentation for your code.

## A Word of Caution: The Pitfalls of Over-Reliance
While AI is an incredibly powerful tool for coding, it’s crucial to maintain a healthy balance. Here are a few pitfalls I’ve encountered (and learned from):

1. Losing sight of the big picture: Sometimes, in the back-and-forth with AI, it’s easy to lose sight of your overall architecture and design. Always keep your broader goals in mind.
2. Accepting complex solutions for simple problems: AI might sometimes suggest overly complex solutions. Always strive for simplicity unless complexity is truly needed.
3. Neglecting to learn the underlying concepts: It’s tempting to just use AI-generated code without fully understanding it. Resist this urge! Always take the time to learn and understand.
4. Ignoring performance implications: AI might not always generate the most performant code out of the box. Always consider the performance implications, especially for critical parts of your system.

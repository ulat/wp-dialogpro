# ADR 001: WordPress Dialog Pro Plugin Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to design a WordPress plugin architecture for Dialog Pro that will:
- Handle AI-powered chat functionality
- Support multiple API providers
- Manage chat sessions and message history
- Provide a flexible and maintainable codebase
- Allow for future extensions and modifications
- Handle settings and configuration
- Provide an intuitive frontend interface

The key challenge is creating a modular system that balances flexibility with simplicity and performance.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Monolithic Architecture
- Single large class handling all functionality
- Direct coupling between components
- Simpler initial implementation
- Limited flexibility and harder to maintain

### Option 2: Component-Based Architecture with Direct Instantiation
- Separate classes for different responsibilities
- Components directly instantiated
- Moderate flexibility
- Still has coupling issues

### Option 3: Service Container Architecture (Selected)
- Component-based with dependency injection
- Service container for managing dependencies
- Interface-based design
- Event-driven communication
- Lazy loading of components

## Decision
We chose Option 3: Service Container Architecture with the following structure:

1. Core Components:
```php
- DialogProCore (Orchestrator)
- DialogProContainer (Service Container)
- DialogProSettings (Configuration)
- DialogProAPI (External Communication)
- DialogProInterface (Frontend)
- DialogProSession (State Management)
- DialogProMessages (Message Processing)
```

2. Key Design Patterns:
- Service Container for dependency management
- Interface-based design for API providers
- Observer pattern for event handling
- Factory pattern for message creation

## Consequences

### Positive
1. Modularity
- Components can be developed and tested independently
- Easy to add new features without modifying existing code
- Clear separation of concerns

2. Maintainability
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Dependencies are clearly defined
- Easier to debug and modify

3. Flexibility
- Support for multiple API providers
- Easy to extend with new features
- Components can be swapped out as needed

4. Testing
- Components can be unit tested in isolation
- Mock dependencies easily
- Better test coverage

### Negative
1. Complexity
- More complex initial setup
- More files and classes to manage
- Steeper learning curve for new developers

2. Performance
- Slight overhead from dependency injection
- Memory usage for service container
- Potential impact from event system

3. Development Time
- More initial boilerplate code required
- More planning needed for interfaces
- Additional documentation needed

## Related Decisions

1. Data Storage
- Using WordPress options table for settings
- Custom tables for chat history
- Session data in transients

2. API Communication
```php
interface DialogProAPIProvider {
    public function send_message($message);
    public function get_response();
}
```

3. Frontend Implementation
- React for chat interface
- WordPress REST API for backend communication
- Enqueued assets using WordPress hooks

## Notes
- Regular review needed to ensure architecture meets growing requirements
- Documentation crucial for maintaining architectural integrity
- Consider performance monitoring for service container impact
- Plan for caching strategy implementation
- Consider migration path for future major versions
